# Part 1  Imaging Technique Inspiration
1. **Introduction**

   This interactive art installation is made for children who visit hospitals. Its goal is to help reduce their anxiety and make the experience more enjoyable. When children touch the screen, they can create fun real-time animations, like plants growing or rockets launching, with different themes.

   The design focuses on kids to make them feel less scared about going to the hospital. By using this installation, children can have fun while waiting and also boost their imagination and creativity.

# Part 2  Coding Technique Exploration

1. **Imaging technique**

   In this interactive wall design, pressure sensors are embedded within the wall to detect children's movements. As they move closer or touch the wall, the interactive system responds with corresponding animations. This system integrates with an **LED display**, which showcases dynamic lighting effects based on the children’s interactions.

   The **HTML5** `<canvas>` element is commonly used to create real-time animations. With **JavaScript** coding, the system can capture children's touch interactions, such as touch start, move, and end. Depending on the location and pressure of the touch, the system generates animations in real time, creating an engaging and immersive experience.
